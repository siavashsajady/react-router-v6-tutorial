# About This Repository

This repository belongs to my "how to upgrading React Router from V5 to V6 in ourÂ projects" Medium Blog [Post]().

Also check out the official [docs](https://reactrouter.com/) and the official [v5 => v6 upgrade guide](https://reactrouter.com/docs/en/v6/upgrading/v5).

# How To Use

The code is primarily meant to be used for comparison (i.e. you compare your code with mine). You can of course also download or clone the repository though. If you do that, you can `npm install` all dependencies and start the development server via `npm start`.
